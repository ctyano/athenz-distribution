## Minimum setup on a Kubernetes cluster ⎈

⚠️  Prerequisite: A [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) Cluster must be set up before continuing to further steps.

```
make clean-kubernetes-athenz deploy-kubernetes-athenz
```

You can access Athenz UI at http://localhost:3000 by forwarding requests.

```
kubectl -n athenz port-forward deployment/athenz-ui 3000:3000
```

To see how Athenz authorization scenarios work, check out the [Kubernetes Showcase](docs/SHOWCASES_KUBERNETES.md) to run the entire ecosystem.

### Named kind clusters

The kind targets use the cluster selected by the current kubectl context. For example, `kind-test` selects the cluster named `test`. Image loading checks that the context matches the selected cluster and loads images into that cluster's nodes.

You can also select the cluster explicitly:

```sh
make load-kubernetes-images KIND_CLUSTER_NAME=test
```

## Minimum setup on Docker 🐳

⚠️  Prerequisite: [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) must be set up before continuing to further steps.

```
make clean-docker-athenz deploy-docker-athenz
```

You can access Athenz UI at http://localhost:3000 by forwarding requests.

```
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml start ghostunnel
```
